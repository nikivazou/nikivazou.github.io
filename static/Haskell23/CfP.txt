 ACM SIGPLAN                                             CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS

                             Haskell Symposium 2023

                                Seattle, WA, USA
                         Fri 8 -- Sat 9 September, 2023

                 http://www.haskell.org/haskell-symposium/2023/

================================================================================

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2023 will be co-located with the 2023
International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP).

As with last year, Haskell'23 will use a single-track submission process. That
is, we will only have the regular track and no early track.

The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical
experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of
declarative programming.

Topics of interest include:

  * Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of
    Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;

  * Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future
    extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program
    analysis and transformation;

  * Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static and
    dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures,
    memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces;

  * Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional
    programming in Haskell;

  * Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing
    tools;

  * Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia,
    telecommunication, the web, and so forth;

  * Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples;

  * Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in
    education, industry, or other contexts;

  * Tutorials, to document how to use a particular language feature, programming
    technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem;

  * System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel research
    results.

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where
appropriate.

Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original
academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable
programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience
that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key
criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other
Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution
to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used
Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting.

Like an experience report and a functional pearl, tutorials should make a
contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. What distinguishes a
tutorial is that its focus is on explaining an aspect of the Haskell language
and/or ecosystem in a way that is generally useful to a Haskell audience.
Tutorials for many such topics can be found online; the distinction here is that
by writing it up for formal review it will be vetted by experts and formally
published.

System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be
demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is
likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large,
whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical,
social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about
the relevance of a proposal.

If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your
experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such,
by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper,
System Demonstration).

Submission Details
==================

Formatting
----------

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using
the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the `acmart` format, with
the `sigplan` sub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see:

  http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format

It is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper; this
option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.

Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be
labelled clearly as such.

Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing
----------------------------------

Haskell Symposium 2023 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To
facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

 1. Author names and institutions must be omitted, and
 2. References to authors' own related work should be in the third person
    (e.g., not "We build on our previous work" but rather "We build on the work of ").

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial
judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to
discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of
anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper
more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or
anonymised). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or
draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may
post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review is
submitted.

Page Limits
-----------

The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits:

Regular paper:      12 pages
Functional pearl:   12 pages
Tutorial:           12 pages
Experience report:   6 pages
Demo proposal:       2 pages

There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a functional pearl
may be much shorter than 12 pages. In all cases, the list of references is not
counted against these page limits.

Deadlines
---------

Paper submission:        1 June 2023      (Thu)
Notification:            4 July 2023      (Tue)
Camera ready:           18 July 2023      (Tue)

Deadlines are anywhere on Earth.

Submission
----------

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy
(http://sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/), and authors should be
aware of ACM's policies on plagiarism
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). Program Committee
members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher
standard.

The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm. There will be no
extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will be summarily
rejected.

Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at:

  https://haskell23.hotcrp.com/

Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submission
deadline using the same web interface.

Supplementary material: Authors have the option to attach supplementary material
to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at
it. This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of the main
document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF document or tarball.
Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by providing a
URL in the paper that points to an external repository. Authors can distinguish
between anonymised and non-anonymised supplementary material. Anonymised
supplementary material will be visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymised
supplementary material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have
submitted their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s).

Resubmitted Papers: authors who submit a revised version of a paper that has
previously been rejected by another conference have the option to attach an
annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), explaining how
they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submission. If a
reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and
wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the conference chair
will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous review.
Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of the previous reviews.

Proceedings
===========

Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors will
be required to choose one of the following options:

  - Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive
    permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a
    Creative Commons license);

  - Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive
    permission-to-publish license;

  - Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

For more information, please see ACM Copyright Policy
(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy) and ACM Author
Rights (http://authors.acm.org/main.html).

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the symposium
website but not formally published in the proceedings.

Publication date: The official publication date of accepted papers is the date
the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be
up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official
publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to
published work.

Artefacts
=========

Authors are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artefacts like source code,
test data, etc.) available with their paper. Authors can opt to have these
artefacts published alongside their paper in the ACM Digital Library (copyright
of artefacts remains with the authors). Artefacts must be included as part of
their submission to HotCRP and should consist of a .zip file containing the
artefact materials, a README explaining the contents of the artefact and how it
should be used, and a LICENSE file.

If an accepted paper's artefacts are made permanently available for retrieval in
a publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM Digital Library, that
paper qualifies for an Artefact badge
(https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging).
