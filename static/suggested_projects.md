Here is a collection of Liquid Haskell cool projects I want to (I wish I had the time to) work on

- [Correctness of Program Transormations](https://github.com/nikivazou/nikivazou.github.io/blob/master/static/program_equivalence_project.md)
- Use Liquid Haskell to check [Graham's chapter 16](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html).
- Use label's to check strictness annoations.
- Give proper annotations to Parallel Library to check parallel models.
